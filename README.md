# **HawtLib**
A collection of C++ Libraries

## **Getting Started**

Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/HawtStrokes/HawtLib`.

In a command line (terminal) run premake5 (a Windows binary executable is provided in the External folder) with the appropriate 'action' parameter—vs2017, vs2019, etc. 

`External/premake/premake5.exe [action]`

This should generate the necessary project files.

## **Current Libraries Included**
1. **HawtTables** – table creation library
2. **HawtText** – text formatting library
3. **HawtProfiling** – profiling library
4. **HawtParsing** – file parsing library (currenly only supports INI)
5. **HawtCrypto** – cryptograhic library

## **Documentations**
Currently there are no documentation. However, the repository hawtstrokes/hawtstrokes.github.io will be the website to be used.
An exact copy of the contents of the hawtlib directory of that repo can be found in HawtLib/Docs/
